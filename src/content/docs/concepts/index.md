# Key Concepts

This section covers the fundamental concepts and principles behind the DRAGON Stack architecture.

## Cloud-Native Architecture

DRAGON Stack is built with cloud-native principles in mind, including:

- **Containers**: Lightweight, portable, and consistent deployment units
- **Microservices**: Small, independent services that work together
- **Declarative APIs**: Desired state management
- **Service Mesh**: Managed service-to-service communication

## Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

- **Definition**: Managing and provisioning infrastructure through code
- **Benefits**: Version control, consistency, and repeatability
- **Tools**: Terraform, Pulumi, or CloudFormation

## GitOps

- **Definition**: Using Git as a single source of truth for declarative infrastructure and applications
- **Principles**:
  - Declarative configuration
  - Version controlled
  - Automated deployment
  - Self-healing systems

## Observability

- **Logging**: Centralized log collection and analysis
- **Metrics**: Time-series data for monitoring
- **Tracing**: Distributed transaction monitoring
- **Alerting**: Proactive notification of issues

## Security

- **Zero Trust**: Never trust, always verify
- **Least Privilege**: Minimum permissions required
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
- **Compliance**: Built-in support for regulatory requirements

## Developer Experience

- **Local Development**: Fast feedback loops
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive and up-to-date
- **Tooling**: Consistent development environment
- **APIs**: Well-documented and versioned

## Multi-Cloud Strategy

- **Portability**: Work across different cloud providers
- **Vendor Neutrality**: Avoid lock-in
- **Cost Optimization**: Leverage best-of-breed services
- **Resilience**: Distribute across providers for high availability
