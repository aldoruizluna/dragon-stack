# DRAGON Stack Architecture

## Overview

The DRAGON Stack is organized into six tiers, each serving a specific purpose in the cloud ecosystem. This modular architecture allows for flexibility, scalability, and maintainability.

## Core Tiers

### T-0: Drive Core
**Physical & Network Layer**
- Bare metal infrastructure
- Network architecture
- Hardware resources

### T-1: Reactor

- Container orchestration
- Service mesh
- Infrastructure automation

### T-2: Ark
**Data & Event Layer**
- Data storage solutions
- Event streaming
- Data processing

### T-3: Gateway
**Domain Apps & Services**

## Design Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each tier has a clear, distinct responsibility.
2. **Loose Coupling**: Tiers interact through well-defined interfaces.
3. **Scalability**: Each tier can scale independently based on demand.
4. **Resilience**: Built-in redundancy and fault tolerance at each layer.
5. **Security**: Defense in depth with security at every tier.
